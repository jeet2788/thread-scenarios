This is an example of Join in Thread. Assume a situation where we are having a petrol pump
and there often a lot of people comes daily and the proper Queue system is not maintained.
So we have tried to leverage the join so that until and unless one 
people comes and leaves the pump then only the next person can fuel the car.
